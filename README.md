It is a simple and basic Java program to print "Hello and Welcome!".
The very first line "public class Main" is used to define a class. Here :
public is an access modifier
class is a keyword which is used to define a class. class is a blueprint of instnces in the class.
Main is the name of the class
The entire class defination along with all the methods and other unctions are enclosed within curly braces "{}".

Further the main function is written. The signature or format of main function is "ublic static void main(String[] args)".
Here public is again an access modifier. It signifies that Java Virtual Machine or the JVM can execute the ethod from anywhere.
The static keyword signifies that main method can be called without an object.
void keyword signifies that method does not returns anything. It is a return type.
String[] in the parenthesis signifies that main ethod accepts a single argument i.e. an array of string type elements.

Moreover, System.out.println() is used to print output to the output screen.
Note that Main and main are completely different. Main is name of the class and main is a method without which a java program may not run. Java is a case sensitive language and hence, Main and main are not same.
Also Note that name of the file should be class_name followed by .java extension.
Here, name of the class is Main. This is why the name of the file is Main.java
